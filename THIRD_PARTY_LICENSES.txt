                        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 2, June 1991

    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                                Preamble

    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.

    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.

    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.

    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.

                        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.

        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.

    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,

        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.

    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.

    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.

    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.

    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.

    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.

    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.

        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
        with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
        51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:

        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
    `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

    Ty Coon, President of Vice

    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
    Public License instead of this License.

    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your

    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

    not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
    these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
    there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
    introduced by others.

    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
    any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
    restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
    ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
    libraries into non-free programs.

    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
    combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
    the library.

    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
    Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
    of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
    libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
    special circumstances.

    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
    a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
    allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
    free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
    system.

    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
    that program using a modified version of the Library.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
    be combined with the library in order to run.

                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
    Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
    which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
    included without limitation in the term "modification".)

    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
    and installation of the library.

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
    and what the program that uses the Library does.

    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
    Library.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
    fee.

    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
        in the event an application does not supply such function or
        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
        its purpose remains meaningful.

        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
        application-supplied function or table used by this function must
        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
        root function must still compute square roots.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
    it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Library.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.

    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
    these notices.

    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
    the Library into a program that is not a library.

    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange.

    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
    library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
    Library will still fall under Section 6.)

    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications.

    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
    of these things:

        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
        to use the modified definitions.)

        b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
        copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
        rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
        will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
        the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
        interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

        c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
        least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
        than the cost of performing this distribution.

        d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
        specified materials from the same place.

        e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
    the executable.

    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
    distribute.

    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
        Sections above.

        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Library or works based on it.

    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
    this License.

    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.

    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.

    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.

    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
    and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.

                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
    ordinary General Public License).

    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

        This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
        version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

        This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
        Lesser General Public License for more details.

        You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
    library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
    Ty Coon, President of Vice

    That's all there is to it!

    Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

    Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
    conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
    original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
    and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
    following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
    exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

        Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
        intended for use by those authorized to give the public
        permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
        copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
        irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
        and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
        Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
        applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
        material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any

        Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
        licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
        licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
        the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
        example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
        copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
        licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
        other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
        the licensed material may still be restricted for other
        reasons, including because others have copyright or other
        rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
        such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
        Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
        respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

    Section 2 -- Scope.

    a. License grant.

        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
            the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
            non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
            exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

                a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                in part; and

                b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
            Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
            License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
            its terms and conditions.

        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
            6(a).

        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
            Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
            all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
            and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
            Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
            authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
            necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
            technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
            Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
            simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
            (4) never produces Adapted Material.

        5. Downstream recipients.

                a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                Public License.

                b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

                c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                Material.

        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
            may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
            are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
            with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
            the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
            provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

    b. Other rights.

        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
            licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
            privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
            the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
            assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
            extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
            Rights, but not otherwise.

        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
            Public License.

        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
            collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
            Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
            under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
            licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
            reserves any right to collect such royalties.


    Section 3 -- License Conditions.

    Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
    following conditions.

    a. Attribution.

        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
            form), You must:

                a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                with the Licensed Material:

                    i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                        Material and any others designated to receive
                        attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                        the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                        designated);

                    ii. a copyright notice;

                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                    iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                        warranties;

                    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                        extent reasonably practicable;

                b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

                c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                hyperlink to, this Public License.

        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
            reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
            reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
            hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
            information.

        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
            information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
            reasonably practicable.

    b. ShareAlike.

        In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
        Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

        1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
            license with the same License Elements, this version or
            later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.

        2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
            Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
            in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
            context in which You Share Adapted Material.

        3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
            or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
            Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
            rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.


    Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

    Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
    apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
        to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
        portion of the contents of the database;

    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
        contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
        Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
        Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,

        including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
        all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
    replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
    Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


    Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

    a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
        EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
        AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
        ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
        IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
        WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
        ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
        KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
        ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
        TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
        NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
        INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
        COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
        USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
        DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
        IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
        above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
        possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
        waiver of all liability.


    Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
        Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
        this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
        terminate automatically.

    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
        Section 6(a), it reinstates:

        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
            it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
            violation; or

        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
        right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
        of this Public License.

    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
        Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
        distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
        will not terminate this Public License.

    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
        License.


    Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
        terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
        Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
        independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


    Section 8 -- Interpretation.

    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
        shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
        conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
        be made without permission under this Public License.

    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
        deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
        minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
        cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
        without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
        conditions.

    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
        failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
        Licensor.

    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
        as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
        that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
        processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

        Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
        are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
        rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

    2.6. Fair Use

        This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
        copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

    2.7. Conditions

        Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
        Section 2.1.


    3. Responsibilities

    3.1. Distribution of Source Form

        All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
        Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
        terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
        of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
        they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
        restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

        If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

        a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
            as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
            Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
            reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
            of distribution to the recipient; and

        b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
            or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
            the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
            rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

        You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
        provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
        Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
        with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
        Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
        You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
        such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
        their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
        either this License or such Secondary License(s).

    3.4. Notices

        You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
        copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
        of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
        Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
        required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

    3.5. Application of Additional Terms

        You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
        Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
        of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
        warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
        alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
        liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
        disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
        jurisdiction.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
    to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
    they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
    distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
    understand it.

    5. Termination

    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
        fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
        then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
        are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
        explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
        if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
        reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
        Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
        ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
        some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
        non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
        compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
        infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
        and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
        indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
        all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
        shall terminate.

    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
        license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
        validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
        termination shall survive termination.

    6. Disclaimer of Warranty

    Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
    warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
    without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
    merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
    risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
    Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
    Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
    correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
    License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
    except under this disclaimer.

    7. Limitation of Liability

    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
    distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
    character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
    informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
    shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
    party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

    8. Litigation

    Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
    a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
    and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
    reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
    prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

    9. Miscellaneous

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
    provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
    enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
    contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
    this License against a Contributor.


    10. Versions of the License

    10.1. New Versions

        Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
        10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
        publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
        distinguishing version number.

    10.2. Effect of New Versions

        You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
        the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
        under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
        steward.

    10.3. Modified Versions

        If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
        create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
        version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
        references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
        modified license differs from this License).

    10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
        If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
        Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
        notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

    Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

    This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
    2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file,
     You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

    If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
    You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
    directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

    You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

    Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

        This Source Code Form is “Incompatible
        With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation
    or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled
    object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form,
    made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is
    included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix
    below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
    that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
    revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a
    whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License,
    Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or
    merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative
    Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
    version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or

    purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic,
    verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its
    representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
    mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
    are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing
    and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously
    marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
    Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
    behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently
    incorporated within the Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
    reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
    sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
    Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
    this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
    import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to
    those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
    infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
    Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
    If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
    Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
    patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
    License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
    filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
    Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and
    in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
        copy of this License; and You must cause any modified files to carry
        prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and You must
        retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
        all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the
        Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
        any part of the Derivative Works; and If the Work includes a "NOTICE"
        text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that
        You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
        contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
        following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
        Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
        along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
        Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
        appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
        only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
        addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
        attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
        provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
        Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
        distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
        in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
    Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
    Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without
    any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing
    herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement
    you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except
    as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
    Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
    writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
    Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
    KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
    warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
    the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
    in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
    applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
    in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
    any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
    character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
    to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
    commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
    the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
    or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
    acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
    and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
    obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
    responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
    agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
    liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
    reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
